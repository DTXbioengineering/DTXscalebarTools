DTXscalebarTools
================

Scalebar Tools for ImageJ. These files are macros for ImageJ and its derivatives (Fiji, MacBiophotonics ImageJ, etc.) that allow batch addition of scalebars to images based on spatial calibration scales.

They are most useful for researchers working with microscopy images.

Installation
============

Copy the /DTXbioengineering folder to your local ImageJ/plugins folder.
